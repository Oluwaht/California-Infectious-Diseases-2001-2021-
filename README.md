# California-Infectious-Diseases-2001-2021

This data contain case counts and rates for selected communicable diseases—listed in the data dictionary—that met the surveillance case definition for that disease and was reported for California residents, by disease, county, year, and sex. The data represent cases with an estimated illness onset date from 2001 through the last year indicated from California Confidential Morbidity Reports and/or Laboratory Reports. Data captured represent reportable case counts as of the date indicated in the “Temporal Coverage” section below, so the data presented may differ from previous publications due to delays inherent to case reporting, laboratory reporting, and epidemiologic investigation.
