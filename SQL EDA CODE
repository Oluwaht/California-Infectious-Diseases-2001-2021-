-- QUESTION 1: What is the overall trend of infectious diseases in California from 2001 to 2021?

SELECT Year, SUM(Cases) AS Total_Cases
FROM California.diseases
WHERE Year BETWEEN 2001 AND 2021
GROUP BY Year
ORDER BY Year;

-- QUESTION 2: Which counties have consistently reported the highest and lowest cases for infectious diseases?

SELECT 
    County,
    SUM(Cases) AS Total_Cases
FROM California.diseases
GROUP BY County
ORDER BY Total_Cases DESC; 

-- QUESTION 3: Is there any significant difference in disease prevalence between males and females across different diseases? Not querying the total cases

SELECT 
    Disease,
    Sex,
    AVG(Cases) AS Average_Cases
FROM 
    California.diseases
GROUP BY 
    Disease, Sex
ORDER BY Average_Cases DESC;


-- QUESTION 4: Are certain diseases more prevalent in one gender compared to the other?

SELECT 
    Disease,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Sex = 'Male' THEN Cases ELSE 0 END) AS Male_Cases,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Sex = 'Female' THEN Cases ELSE 0 END) AS Female_Cases
FROM 
    California.diseases
GROUP BY 
    Disease
ORDER BY 
    Female_Cases DESC, Male_Cases DESC;



-- QUESTION 5: Can we identify any trends in gender-based disease prevalence over time?

SELECT 
    Disease,
    Year,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Sex = 'Male' THEN Cases ELSE 0 END) AS Male_Cases,
    SUM(CASE WHEN Sex = 'Female' THEN Cases ELSE 0 END) AS Female_Cases
FROM

---- QUESTION 6: How do confidence intervals vary between different diseases and counties? (DONE)

SELECT 
    Disease,
    County,
    MAX(Upper_95__CI - Lower_95__CI) AS Confidence_Interval_Width
FROM 
    California.diseases
GROUP BY

-- QUESTION 7: How does the distribution of different diseases vary across counties and years?

SELECT 
    Disease,
    County,
